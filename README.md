# Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game allows two players to control paddles on opposite sides of the screen and compete against each other to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle library (usually included with Python installation)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```bash
   python pong.py
   ```

4. Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to control the right paddle.
5. Use the `W` and `S` keys to control the left paddle.
6. The game will continue until one player scores 10 points and is declared the winner.

## Game Controls

- Player 1 (left paddle):
  - Move Up: `W` key
  - Move Down: `S` key

- Player 2 (right paddle):
  - Move Up: `Up` arrow key
  - Move Down: `Down` arrow key

## Game Rules

- The ball will start moving towards a random direction at the beginning of each round.
- Each time the ball hits a paddle, its speed will increase slightly.
- If the ball goes past a paddle and reaches the left or right edge of the screen, the opposing player scores a point.
- The game will continue until one player reaches 10 points, at which point the winner will be declared.
